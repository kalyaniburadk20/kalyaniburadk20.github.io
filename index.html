                    <h3>Project 1: Speech enhancement Deep learning project</h3>
                    <p>The speech enhancement project aimed to improve the clarity and quality of speech signals impacted by background noise using deep learning techniques. I learned about various neural network architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and how to prepare and preprocess audio data for training models. The tech stack included Python for programming, TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the models, and libraries like Librosa for audio processing. This project not only enhanced my understanding of signal processing but also gave me hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks and the challenges of working with real-world audio data.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: MERN Quiz-maker</h3>
                    <p>The MERN Quiz-maker project is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and take quizzes online. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the project enables a seamless user experience with a dynamic front-end interface and a robust back-end server. Throughout this project, I learned how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies, manage state in React, and perform CRUD operations with MongoDB. The tech stack also involved using Express.js for handling API requests and Node.js for server-side logic. This experience enhanced my skills in full-stack development, particularly in building interactive applications and understanding database management.</p>
